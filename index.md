## Your Dissertation Is Not a _Document_.<br />It Is a _Project_.

<blockquote style="width: 80vw">Every [Git] repository is a complete, self-contained, cryptographically
signed copy of [your dissertation], with a log of every recorded step in its
development… It puts you in the habit of committing
changes to a file or project piecemeal as you work on it, and (briefly)
documenting those changes as you go. It allows you to easily test out
alternative lines of development or thinking by creating “branches” of a
project… Perhaps most importantly, it lets you revisit any stage of a
project’s development at will and reconstruct what it was you were doing.</blockquote>
