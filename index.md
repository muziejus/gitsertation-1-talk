## While All That‚Äôs Downloading, Why Atom?

<ol>
<li class="fragment">Free</li>
<li class="fragment">Similar across platforms</li>
<li class="fragment">One-stop shop with integrated shell</li>
<li class="fragment">Excellent Git/GitHub support built in</li>
</ol>

## Isn‚Äôt Google Docs Free and Platform Agnostic?

<ol>
<li class="fragment">‚ÄúFree‚Äù</li>
<li class="fragment">Ethics, Availability, and Sustainability of Plain Text (see <a href="https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown">Tenen and Wythoff</a>)</li>
</ol>

## OK, but *Git*?

<ol>
<li class="fragment">Not Git. Please not Git.</li>
</ol>

## Git Is‚Ä¶

* ‚Äúfree and open source distributed version control system designed to handle
everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.‚Äù
* ‚Äúeasy to learn.‚Äù
* A busybody keeping track of all the changes to all your files and never
forgetting them.

Note: That part about ‚Äúeasy to learn‚Äù is probably not true. Git is insanely
powerful, and even people who use it every day probably don‚Äôt use more than a
tiny chunk of it. And that‚Äôs because what IS easy is learning just enough Git
to make it useful for you.

## Git Is‚Ä¶

<ol>
<li class="fragment">Part of a backup solution</li>
<li class="fragment">An intention tracker/writing journal</li>
<li class="fragment">A declutterer</li>
<li class="fragment">A multi-verse generator</li>
<li class="fragment">A collaboration engine</li>
</ol>

## The Four Main Steps to Git

<ol>
<li class="fragment">Save - continuous (with autosave). Not even part of Git.</li>
<li class="fragment">Stage - less frequent. Also known as `git add`.</li>
<li class="fragment">Commit - less frequent still.</li>
<li class="fragment">Push - less frequent still.</li>
</ol>

Note: Saving is what you already do. The files you work with have changes that
get saved to the disk. Then, in staging a file, you‚Äôre giving Git a heads up
to keep track of the changes you have made. In committing, you‚Äôre putting down
a milestone for the changes the files have undergone. And in pushing, you‚Äôre
syncing your new changes with a server.

Note: Here‚Äôs a slightly more visual way to think about this. But you‚Äôll notice
here that I‚Äôm talking about ‚Äúchanges,‚Äù not a ‚Äúdocument.‚Äù This is a central
conceit of Git.

---

## You‚Äôre not working on a _document_.<br />You‚Äôre working on a _project_.

Note: For the rest of today, we‚Äôll be working on a project that is your CV.
It‚Äôs not a single document. In fact, it‚Äôs many--it‚Äôs at least the html page
that is your online CV and the pdf that is the print version. In a project,
files come and go. They could be datasets, collections of text like chapters
or sections of an article, or even, like in today‚Äôs workshop, the various
parts of your CV.

## Working with Git via GitHub <i class="fab fa-github"></i> and Simple-Data-Site

1. Create an account at [github.com](http://github.com)
1. Fork the [`simple-data-site`
   repository](http://github.com/plain-plain-text/simple-data-site) (or ‚Äúproject.‚Äù)
1. Enable GitHub pages on the new repository

---

## Back to Atom

1. Install Atom plugins: [github.com/plain-plain-text/atom-config/](http://github.com/plain-plain-text/atom-config)
1. Clone your own, forked `simple-data-site` repository from GitHub via Atom‚Äôs
   Command Palette (cmd-shift-p or ctrl-shift-p).
1. Link Atom to GitHub via the GitHub panel in Atom.

Note: Atom is brought to us by the people at GitHub. It probably won‚Äôt win you
any cool kid awards amongst your hacker nerd friends, but it‚Äôs an easy editor
to learn, I think, and its Git integration is tip-top.
